 A closure is created when a function "remembers" the variables from its lexical scope even after the outer function
has finished executing.
Closures are formed automatically whenever you use a function inside another.
They help maintain state across multiple function calls.
They are heavily used in React hooks, Node.js callbacks, async code, functional programming.

<script>
    function outer() {
        let count = 0;   // outer function variable

        function inner() {
            count++;       // inner function uses outer variable
            console.log(count);
        }

        return inner;
    }

    const counter = outer();
    counter(); // 1
    counter(); // 2
    counter(); // 3
